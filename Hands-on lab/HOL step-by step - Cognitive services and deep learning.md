## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a solution which combines both pre-built artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of various Cognitive Services, with custom AI in the form of services built and deployed with Azure Machine Learning service. You will learn to create intelligent solutions atop unstructured text data by designing and implementing a text analytics pipeline. You will discover how to build a binary classifier using a simple neural network that can be used to classify the textual data, as well as how to deploy multiple kinds of predictive services using Azure Machine Learning and learn to integrate with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API from Cognitive Services.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement solutions leveraging Azure Machine Learning service and Cognitive Services.

## Overview

In this workshop, you will help Contoso Ltd. build a proof of concept that shows how they can build a solution that amplifies the claims processing capabilities of their agents.

## Solution architecture

The high-level architecture of the solution is illustrated in the diagram. The lab is performed within the context of a notebook running within Azure Notebooks. Various notebooks are built to test the integration with the Cognitive Services listed, to train custom ML services, and to integrate the results in a simple user interface that shows the result of processing the claim with all of the AI services involved.

![The High-level architectural solution begins with a Claim, which us submitted for processing using a notebook in Azure Databricks. This notebook coordinates the calls to Computer Vision, Text Analytics, and Containerized Services, which includes a Classification Service and a Summary Service that both process claim text.](media/image2.png 'High-level architectural solution')

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

    a. Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

    b. Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

## Exercise 1: Setup Azure Notebooks Project

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will setup your Azure Notebooks Project.

### Task 1: Upload project files

1.  Log in to [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/).

2.  Navigate to **My Projects** page.

3.  Select **Upload GitHub Repo**.

4. In the Upload GitHub Repository dialog, for the GitHub repository provide `https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Cognitive-services-and-deep-learning.git`, and select **Import**. Allow the import a few moments to complete, the dialog will dismiss once the import has completed.

## Exercise 2: Create and Deploy an Unsupervised Model

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will create and deploy a web service that uses a pre-trained model to summarize long paragraphs of text.

### Task 1: Install libraries

The notebooks you will run depends on certain Python libraries like `azureml-sdk`, `onnxruntime` and `nltk` that will need to be installed. The following steps walk you through adding these dependencies.

1.  Within the `notebooks` folder, click the notebook called `00 init`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2.  Run each cell in the notebook to install the required libraries.

### Task 2: Read through and execute the Summarization notebook

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, click the notebook called `01 Summarize`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

### Task 3: Provision the Azure Machine Learning Workspace and Create the Summarization service

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, click the notebook called `02 Deploy Summarizer Web Service`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.


## Exercise 3: Create and Deploy a Keras Model

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will use Keras to construct and train a simple deep neural network classification model that will classify claim text as belonging to a home insurance claim or an automobile claim. You will then deploy this trained model as a web service.

### Task 1: Create a simple Keras based model

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, click the notebook called `03 Claim Classification`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.

   > Pay attention to the top of the notebook and check the version of  `tensorflow` and `keras` libraries. Tensorflow version should be >= 1.12.2 and Keras version should be >= 2.2.4.

### Task 2: Deploy the Keras model

1. Within the `notebooks` folder, click the notebook called `04 Deploy Classifier Web Service`. This will open the notebook so you can read and execute the code it contains.

2. Read the instructions at the top of the notebook, and execute the cells as instructed.


## Exercise 4: Completing the solution

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will perform the final integration with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API along with the Azure Machine Learning service you previously deployed, to deliver the completed proof of concept solution.

### Task 1: Deploy the Computer Vision API

3.  In the confirmation dialog that appears, enter the name of the resource group and select **Delete**.

4.  Wait for the confirmation that the Resource Group has been successfully deleted. If you don't wait, and the delete fails for some reason, you may be left with resources running that were not expected. You can monitor using the Notifications dialog, which is accessible from the Alarm icon.

    ![The Notifications dialog box has a message stating that the resource group is being deleted.](media/image72.png 'Notifications dialog box')

5.  When the Notification indicates success, the cleanup is complete.

    ![The Notifications dialog box has a message stating that the resource group has been deleted.](media/image73.png 'Notifications dialog box')

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
